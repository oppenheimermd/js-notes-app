##  JavaScripts Notes

<script src="./js/main.js" type="module"></script
    script type="module" - We can make user of the native JavaScript import/export syntax

Static methods -  are often utility functions, such as functions to create or clone objects, whereas 
static properties are useful for caches, fixed-configuration, or any other data you don't need to be 
replicated across instances.

Destructuring assignment - The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes 
it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.
